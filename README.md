# Description

For my assignment I have created a procedurally generated 3D runner game, the player must avoid the random obstacles heading their way and collecting pickups to increase their score.

# Instructions for Use

The project is running on the Unity 2020.3.18f1 Editor version.
Controls are as follows:
W, A, S, D - Movement
R - Reset Game

# How it works

At the start of the game the initial tiles, mesh, obstacles and pickups are spawned, the player can then navigate through the random assortment of these items to get the highest score they can.

# Earlier Proposal
For my procedural generation project, I aim to create a procedurally generated solar system, the planets will be procedurally generated with differing terrains, colours, etc. I hope to depict a scene of an astronaut in space, observing the galaxy before them.
