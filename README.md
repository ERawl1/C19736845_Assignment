# Description

For my assignment I have created a procedurally generated 3D runner game, the player must avoid the random obstacles heading their way and collecting pickups to increase their score.

# Instructions for Use

The project is running on the Unity 2020.3.18f1 Editor version.
Controls are as follows:
W, A, S, D - Movement
R - Reset Game

# Earlier Proposal
For my procedural generation project, I aim to create a procedurally generated solar system, the planets will be procedurally generated with differing terrains, colours, etc. I hope to depict a scene of an astronaut in space, observing the galaxy before them.
